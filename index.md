## Introduction
The idea of this project is to collect my own views on possible paths beyond the standard model,
predicting some of the content that currently looks ad-hoc

Plan is to include an heterogenous mix of references to preprints and [blog](https://a.rivero.nom.es/) entries,
and go refining the explanation of its content, so the ideal final product should be
self contained.

## Technologies 

### Non commutative geometry

### String theory

## Space dimensions
As we know the answer, it is very easy to speculate about things that happens where d=3,
or just cases where the number 3 appears.

On other hand, the content of supergravity, and thus of string theory, have some objects with
a natural split in 4+7 dimensions, or 7+4... they come in dual pairs.

## masses
### empirical formulae
Koide formula for leptons is not really empirical, it is deriver from an abandoned model of preons. But that is
the formula for charged leptons. We have found it to be good enough for quark sequences, and then a main
idea is that it could be justified by some other kind of composites.
### dual from strings
Again, supergravity contains two objects with 84 components, it could be that one of them justifies zero dirac mass,
and the dual justifies zero majorana mass.

## number of generations

the sBootstrap justifies it.

## symmetry group
the sBootstrap idea invites to generate groups bigger than $SO(30)$ and there is the problem of introducing chirality.
Perhaps $$SO(32) \longleftrightarrow E_8 \times E_8 $$ is the way to relate chiral and not chiral
